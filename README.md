# TCP-Server

This is a TCP Server created by me by following https://www.cs.uic.edu/~troy/fall99/eecs471/sockets.html
to practice C, learn basic UNIX networking stuff and to get a basic idea of socket programming.
I have tried to create a TCP Client as there are no unit tests in C.
I might update it regularly. 


Enjoy.
